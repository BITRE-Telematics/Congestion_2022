<p>There was no consistent pattern to changes in mean average travel time between 2021 and 2022 across Adelaide metropolitan area key freight vehicle routes. Two routes – the A14 and A22 – exhibited an increase in mean average travel time in one direction and a decrease in the other direction. Average travel times fell between 2021 and 2022 across the majority of routes, however these decreases were almost equally offset by measured increased travel times on the A2-M2 route, such that the city wide METR measure remained stable.</p>
<p>Travel time uncertainty exhibited little change across most routes between 2021 and 2022. However, increases on the heavily-weighted A2-M2 and a large increase in travel time uncertainty on the A20 (southbound) resulted in an increase in the overall city-wide measure.</p>
