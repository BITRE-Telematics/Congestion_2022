<p>Most routes exhibited little change in travel time congestion between 2021 and 2022. The major exception is the lightly-weighted M3-A3, where travel time congestion declined significantly in the southbound direction (i.e. M1 to Airport Link). Modest reductions in travel time congestion across many routes more than offset the slight increase on the highly-weighted M1 to produce a 2.5 per cent decline in the result city-wide mean excess time index.</p>
<p>Similarly, modest decreases in congestion uncertainty across a majority of motorway routes in Brisbane, between 2021 and 2022, more than offset increased uncertainty on the M1 to lead to city-wide falls.</p>
