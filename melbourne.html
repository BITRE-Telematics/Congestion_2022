<p>Travel time congestion changed unevenly across Melbourne arterial roads, with both large increases and large decreases, but most motorway routes exhibited increases, particularly on the M1 East (Monash Freeway) and the M80 (the Western Ring Road), both of which are major freight routes. These routes contributed to city wide increases. However, there was little change in congestion uncertainty across most routes, with the notable exceptions of the M1 East and M3 where congestion uncertainty declined, which contributed to a city-wide decrease in congestion uncertainty.</p>
