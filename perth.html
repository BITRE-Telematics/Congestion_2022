<p>Mean excess travel time congestion in Perth decreased across most routes between 2021 and 2022, although there were some small increases across a small number of routes.</p>
<p>Similarly, congestion uncertainty generally declined across most routes, and particularly on the heavily weighted Route 2 and Route 4. The low-weighted Route 5 exhibited an anomalously large decrease in congestion uncertainty between 2021 and 2022, that reversed an anomalously large increase in the 2021 report, that was an artefact of the raw data processing procedures.</p>
